## Chris To-do

This is a simple to-do app to help me get in the habbit of using typescript in my personal projects. It's not meant to look super-good or anything, I care more about the functionality.

- Made with Next.js and Typescript
- I will extend this to a full stack app soon and get some actual use out of it.
